PS -- Don't burn the bridges with your current friends. You may feel angry at them for ditching/ignoring you, but building a friendship 
is kind of like building a bridge to an island. Just because you don't need to cross that bridge any more doesn't mean you should tear it 
down. Just leave it be. Maybe sometime in the future, you'll be able to walk down that bridge again and enjoy the friendship.


My motto in life is "If it hasn't happened yet, you don't want it enough". Because that's all there is to it. You've gotta' WANT it. 
More than anything. More than breathing. And when you get to that point, you'll find you can get whatever the hell you desire.



This is a test
